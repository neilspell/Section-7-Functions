# Substitution Exercise 👨🏽‍💻✍🏽

Take a look at the program below:
````py
#  Function to subtract two integers (b from a)
def sub(a, b):
    answer = a - b
    return answer

print(sub(4, 3)) # Answer = 
#print(sub(3, 4)) # Answer = 
#print(sub(3, -4)) # Answer = 

#print( sub( 2, sub(3, 4))) # Answer = 
#print( sub( sub(2, 3), 4)) # Answer = 
#print( sub( 2, sub(3, sub(4, 5)))) # Answer = 
#print( sub( 5, 1))
#print( sub( 1, 5))
#print( sub( 2, sub(4, 3)))
#print( sub( 1, sub(2, sub(3, 4))))
````

### PRIMM
1. Type up the program in `main.py` and try to _PREDICT_ what the function is doing.
2. In your copy write down what you think the answer to `print(sub(4, 3))` will be. ✍🏽 
3. Now, in your copy write down what you think the solutions to the other lines will be. ✍🏽
4. Un-comment the lines 1-by-1 and check your answers.

## 💡Note: 
As a final note, it is worth pointing out that it is not always necessary for a function to return data. 

A return statement may be omitted entirely or can be used without an expression _(i.e. just return on its own)_. In both cases the value returned by Python is ``None.``
