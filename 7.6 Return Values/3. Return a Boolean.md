# Functions that return a Boolean (`True` or `False`).

The function below returns `True` if the name selected is in the list.

````py
# Create a list of names.
names = ["Chris","Alice","Bob","Emma","Danny"]

# Function to check if name is in list of names
def checkNames(n):
    if n in names:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Prompt user for name
nameIn = input("Enter a name: ")

# QUESTION: What is this section of code doing??
if checkNames(nameIn):
    print("Welcome to the club", nameIn)
else:
    print("Your name's not on the list, you're not coming in.")

## Task 2 👨🏽‍💻 
1. Take a look over the program above and see do you understand what it is doing?
2. Type up the code in `main.py` and check your predictions.
3. Can you edit the code so that it will do away with _case-sensitive_ inputs from the user.


### 💡 Note:
From the example above you can see that functions...  
- Can be used to alter the flow of an if statement.
- Can be used several times to check the same list.
